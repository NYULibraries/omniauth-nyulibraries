OmniAuth strategy for the NYU Libraries OAuth2 provider. Before installing in your app, be sure to have installed [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and registered your app with [Login](https://github.com/NYULibraries/login/blob/feature/client_documentation/GETTING_STARTED.md).

# Installation
## Gemfile
In your Gemfile add:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-nyulibraries'
```

Then run `bundle install`

## Config

Go to the __config > initializers__ directory and locate __omniauth.rb__, where you will have to add the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :nyulibraries, YOUR_APP_KEY, YOUR_APP_SECRET
end
```

If you are using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), go to the __config > initializers__ directory and locate __devise.rb__, where you will have to add the following:

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  #...
  #ADD THIS LINE
  config.omniauth :nyulibraries,  YOUR_APP_KEY, YOUR_APP_SECRET
  #...
end
```

Where `YOUR_APP_KEY` and `YOUR_APP_SECRET` are __Application Id__ and __Application Secret__ retrieved from registering your app in __Login__.

## Configuration

By default, `omniauth-nyulibraries` authenticates from __"https://login.dev"__, and uses __"/oauth/authorize"__ as the authorization path. If you want to authenticate from a different instance of Login,
use the `:client_options` option when you add the provider to your app.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :nyulibraries, YOUR_APP_KEY, YOUR_APP_SECRET,
    {
      site: LOGIN_URL,
      authorize_path: AUTHORIZE_PATH
    }
end
```

And in `Devise`:

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  #...
  #ADD THIS LINE
  config.omniauth :nyulibraries,  YOUR_APP_KEY, YOUR_APP_SECRET, client_options: {site: LOGIN_URL, authorize_path: AUTHORIZE_PATH}
  #...
end
```

`LOGIN_URL` would be the URL for __Login__, and `AUTHORIZE_PATH` would be the authorization path you want to use.

## Example Auth Hash

Here is an example hash you can expect out of this strategy by using `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{"provider"=>:nyulibraries,
 "uid"=>"name",
 "info"=>
  {"name"=>"name",
   "nickname"=>"name",
   "email"=>"email@site.com"},
 "credentials"=>
  {"token"=>"token",
   "expires_at"=>1111111111,
   "expires"=>true},
 "extra"=>
  {"provider"=>:nyulibraries,
   "identities"=>nil},}
```

## OAuth2
### Now you're authenticating with power

Congrats! Your app is now connected to the __NYU Libraries login service__. Itâ€™s an OAuth2 provider which means that it offers your client applications the ability to authenticate and request resources (e.g. _username_). Users can now authenticate from any one of the myriad login options __NYU Libraries login service__ offers, and your app will be able to properly identify them.
